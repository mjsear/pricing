The goal of this project is to automate solving pricing models for my Actuarial Mathematics class.

The idea is to be able to input a table of exclusively q(x) rates from a given life table (e.g. AM92), 
and the parameters for a contract (e.g. paying monthly premiums for a 15 year endowment assurance at 4%)
and output the relevant solution, e.g. required premium, the reserves at each interval, etc.
